    #TODO: slide to school bg

    "As was my luck, we arrived at the gates before having to talk more to her about whatever she even talks about."

    "There weren't a lot of people. Everyone who was passing by were people I didn't even know, with some familiar faces among them."

    "I instinctively reached down to my pockets for my phone to check the time, but naturally I didn't have any."

    "Also, I noticed that I forgot to bring her phone."
