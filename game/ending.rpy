    #Rumi's future livingroom
    mc "{i}Sigh...{/i} Finally home..."

    think "Man, work is totally killing me right now."
    think "..."

    "Oh, right."
    "So, we didn't really end up anywhere with the... Uh, well, \"experiments\"."

    "Despite the lack of results, Weeb had actually impressed me at the stuff he could come up with."
    "Like really, I think at some point we ended up catching a fly, cooking it, splitting it in two, and had both me and MC eat one half."
    "I believe the theory would then be that flies carried around some genetic mutation that would enable two people to swap personalities and holy hell does it sound stupid when I think back on it."
    "Honestly I have no idea what went through our minds back then..."
    "Oh, and me and MC now refer to each other by our body name, even while alone. It just makes more sense that way."
    "I can't even count how many times someone managed to eavesdrop us and thought we were crazy or something."
    "...But yeah, life's been surprisingly normal since then."
    "I would have planned to just doze off on the sofa for the rest of the rest of the day, were it not for the fact that I had to get ready for the evening at some point."
    "I knew that PG would appear because I promised her to take home her package-"

    #sfx bell

    "...And speak of the devil, she's probably already here. She was unusually early."

    mc "Why, hello there."

    pg "Rumi! Hey!"
    #animate hug
    "She went straight in for an unexpected hug-attack."

    "Naturally I countered with my own hug."
    mc "Good to see you too."

    pg "Sorry for having me come on a short notice."

    mc "Got nothing better to do."

    pg "Heheh, I suppose not."

    pg "Did my parcel arrive?"

    mc "Yeah yeah. Come on in."

    pg "There it is. About time it arrived."

    mc "I was about to head home before I suddenly saw it lying in front of the office. Talk about luck that I had a longer day than expected."

    pg "Figures."

    "She began slowly unpacking it. I already knew the contents, being new clothes she wanted to wear for today."
    "But that specific set was always out of stock until she managed to get lucky."

    "I was beat from all the work I had to do today, so I went straight to the sofa and sat myself down."

    pg "Everything fine at work?"
    pg "Since you mentioned overtime."

    mc "Oh, yeah, we just have a few deadlines we need to crunch through."

    mc "They want me to do a few extra things because I'm the only woman in programming. You know, with voice-overs and support and stuff."

    pg "You mentioned that before. You sure it doesn't get a bit lonely as the only girl in your department?"

    mc "Nah, it's alright. The guys are pretty cool to hang out with. And I get to talk with some interesting people most of the time."

    pg "If you say so."

    "As if on queue, she managed to finally tear open the box."

    "She lifted up a sweet looking outfit, and her eyes glimmered with excitement."

    pg "Finally, I've been waiting to get my hands on this."

    "She was practically hugging the set of clothes at this point. I kind of felt happy for her that she finally got what she wanted."

    pg "You don't mind if I change here, right? I can give you a lift since you did me this favor."
    mc "Feel free to."

    pg "Thanks."

    pg "But, uh... Are you not going to be under stress if you still want to dress and all that? I already took a shower at uni, but if we want to make it in time, we need to be on the road in thirty minutes."

    mc "Thirty minutes? Isn't that a bit too soon-"

    mc "Oh shoot, it's already a quarter to six!"

    "I got a bit of a shock when I saw the clock. I thought I still had an hour left!"

    pg "Haha, you really didn't notice?"

    mc "They must have fixed the clock at work, it's been on winter time since the start of March!"

    mc "Crap, crap! I'll skip the shower! I'll be sure to be ready by six!"

    "With that, I frantically ran into my bedroom to find the clothes I had laid out for tonight."

    #transition to Castle bg

    "We still managed to be there a bit too late despite my hurrying."
    think "Not like we are the only ones anyways. I saw some couples arriving late as well."
    "They weren't really people I recognized. Most people I know would probably already be here since they were helping with organization and stuff."

    pg "I hope he likes the look."

    mc "You're still addicted to having him tell you that?"

    pg "I'm not addicted! I just like it."

    mc "Right."

    "As we went in, Mom and Aunt Leona were naturally receiving the guests in the lobby area."

    "Mom saw me and waved us over."

    sandra "There you guys are! You almost made me worry you'd be missing out on the welcome speech."

    mc "Hey mom. And hello Leona. Congratulations on the 50 years!"

    pg "Likewise, and thanks for inviting us."

    "We both gave Leona the presents we brought her."
    "Most people I know from family and friends were invited for Leona's 50 year birthday today, and Leona was one of the few who knew about our swap, together with my mom."

    "So in a sense, they were both really close people."
    leona "Thanks, and thank you for coming, you two."

    leona "MC and Weeb are already in the dining room, in case you're looking for them."

    "We nodded, both with a smile on our faces as a thanks, and headed further into the building as more people came to greet both of them."

    #scene rich lunchroom

    "There were loads of people to greet here, so we made a quick round to introduce ourselves to everyone."

    think "I didn't even know Leona had this many acquaintances..."

    "Eventually, I spotted MC and Weeb talking to each other."

    r "-No, look, I'm not going to raise it."

    r "Why do you even want one to begin with?"

    r "Oh, hey girls."

    weeb "Oh?"

    pg "Hey."

    mc "Whazzup."

    r "Drop the attempt at being hip with the times already. Seriously."

    "And here he goes bickering again."

    mc "It's not like I would say that to people I barely know."
    mc "You guys talking about anything particularly interesting?"

    r "It sounds more insane if he explains it."

    r "So go right ahead, what were we talking about?"

    weeb "I cannot really see the \"insane\" in it."

    weeb "I just wanted MC to raise a guard dog for us."

    weeb "I believed it was well within his power to do so since he works with animals on a daily basis."

    r "The entire point of a guard dog is for the guard dog to actually {i}guard you{/i}, you moron."

    r "If I were to raise it then it wouldn't see you as it's master, which totally defeats the entire point of a guard dog."

    pg "Uh, honey, a dog?"

    weeb "Of course. I thought, on days where you were off, you might feel less lonely with a companion around when I am not home."

    pg "Aw. That's kind of sweet, isn't it?"

    mc "I guess it's the thought that counts?"

    r "It's a stupid thought."

    mc "Well aren't you the romantic?"

    weeb "Is that a new outfit you're wearing?"

    pg "Oh? Y- Yeah, I hope you like it..."

    weeb "You look stunning."

    "His praise was apparently something that got PG completely addicted."

    "As he smiled while praising her, she swooned just a little and didn't really mask her red face."

    "He grabbed her around the waist and gave her a little kiss on her forehead."

    "While he was mumbling something to her which I didn't quite catch, me and MC both just sighed."
    "It was a pretty common occurrence for PG to seek praise from this guy, enough to make us both think she has a bit of a problem."

    scene black
    "Before long, we were all seated with Leona briefly saying thanks to everyone for coming and telling us what food she was treating us with."
    "We all knew it was going to be her favorite dish, pulled pork burgers with all kinds of cheese, vegetables and fillings and dressing."
    "Having been invited over for dinner at her home a good few times now really goes to show that you can easily figure out what kind of food they like."
    "It was admittedly a bit weird to consider that I was rather good friends with my high-school English teacher, but I wouldn't complain about it."
    "Having personally aged a bit now, I knew a bit more about the issues adults normally face, and having my mom and Leona as back-up advisors was nice in that regard."
    "Also, they were both cool to hang out with on occasion."

    "My inner thoughts were swiftly interrupted though when MC nudged me, demanding my attention."
    mc "{size=-5}What is it?{/size}"

    r "{size=-5}See that woman over there?{/size}"

    "I followed her eyesight towards a woman I had only seen on a few occasions before, and let out a low grunt to signal a yes."
    r "{size=-5}Her dress.{/size}"

    mc "{size=-5}...What about it?{/size}"

    "I already knew the answer though."

    r "{size=-5}If you get the chance, you should ask her where she got it from.{/size}"

    mc "{size=-5}Yeah yeah, I know...{/size}"

    "Everyone was chatting at this point."

    "The waiters and waitresses were going around and pouring red- and white wine to anyone who wanted some."

    "Since PG was driving, I thought I might as well have some."

    waitress "Would you like a glass?"

    r "Yes. Red wine."

    mc "I'd like some white wine myself, please."

    waitress "Sure."

    "She gave a short smile before pouring it for us to drink."

    "Meanwhile, the food was starting to be served at a separate table for everyone to take from, kind of like a buffet."

    r "One of the best things about becoming a guy is that I'm able to actually eat a good fill of those things."

    r "I kind of pity you for not even being able to stomach just one burger, heh."

    "I just rolled my eyes at her usual flaunting."

    "The waitress looked a bit confused at what MC said though."

    "Which would be natural with him just openly saying something like that."

    waitress "Ah, pardon!"

    "She swiftly moved on to the next guests to offer them wine."

    mc "At least be a {i}bit{/i} subtle about it."

    r "About that girl? Who cares, not like I'm ever going to meet her again."
    mc "Well, your problem."

    "Right now, we were pretty relaxed with nothing really going on between us."
    "He wasn't very tensed up and I wasn't angry at him, so we decided to join the people that were dancing to the music on the dancefloor."
    "Despite how we both got angry at each other way too often, we still enjoyed each other's company at this point. Being angry at each other was just a thing we had."
    "Being practically brother and sister allowed us to have a dynamic like that."
    "And of course, having a bit of drunken fun was enjoyable because of that too."
    "And it's not like I couldn't break a smile out of him every now and then."

    #scene restaurant, PG and Weeb
    waitress "Uhm... Excuse me?"
    weeb "Hm? What is it?"

    waitress "Could I ask about the two you were talking about? Rumi and MC are their names? The gray haired man and the pink haired woman."
    pg "Uh, yeah. What about them?"

    waitress "Are... Uh... This is difficult to really explain properly..."

    waitress "Are they perhaps married or something?"

    pg "Pffahaha, those two?"

    pg "Hell no. They barely even get along most of the time."

    weeb "Yup."

    weeb "But they do share a special bond that goes beyond what most people share."

    pg "A special bond? That's a really poetic way of explaining it."

    pg "But yeah, can't say much more than that they are a special case."

    waitress "Mhm. Interesting."
    pg "Why are you asking?"

    waitress "Oh! Uh...! Nothing! No, really, I was just curious!"

    pg "Uh, alright."

    weeb "{size=-5}Hey PG. She sounds suspicious.{/size}"

    pg "{size=-5}Of course she does you dum-dum.{/size}"

    waitress "I'm terribly sorry for bothering you! I have to get back to the bar now, thank you for talking to me."

    weeb "Our pleasure."

    #outside castle, night
    "It had become late now. 2 o'clock, to be more precise."
    "Most people were getting ready to leave for their beds. And I especially welcomed the thought of getting a good night's sleep."
    "Me and mc were waiting outside for pg and Weeb."
    "Both of them were still inside saying their goodbyes, and since they were driving tonight, we were forced to wait for them."

    r "I love nights like these."

    mc "Where you get something to eat for free?"

    r "No, the atmosphere."

    r "You know, chilly, late night with no skies together with friends."

    r "Kind of makes me feel happy for some reason."

    mc "Oh, yeah. That's nice."

    r "Hey, Mom lives right down the road, I'm sure she has a bed available if you don't want to drive to your home for an hour."

    mc "Nah, it's fine. I'd like to visit her but I'm just not really in the mood for it right now."

    r "Fair enough. Just thought I'd mention it."

    "Right after concluding that talk, I saw someone watching us from behind."

    "Sure enough, someone was looking at us from behind the wall for the establishment."
    "The onlooker shrieked as they realized I knew they were there and retreated."

    r "Something the matter?"

    mc "Oh, nothing."

    mc "There was just someone looking at us from behind there."

    r "...Huh?"

    "He turned his head in curiosity."

    "Of course, he didn't find anything since the person was likely long gone by now."

    r "Anyone you know?"
    mc "No idea who it was."

    r "Hm..."

    r "Come."

    "He grabbed my hand and dragged me along with him, and then headed straight for where the person might be hiding."

    mc "Hey, no! It's going to be extremely awkward if someone was actually watching us and we meet them!"

    r "We're going to be stuck waiting anyways. Let's just make sure it's not some psycho."

    "It was a norm now that he dragged me with him if he felt like it, so I just accepted my fate."

    #extravagant alley
    "Sure enough, that waitress girl that I recognized from the party was just straight up glaring at us in terror as we came into view."

    waitress "Ah! I'm sorry! I shouldn't have spied on you!"

    "MC just looked at me as if expecting me to know what to do in this situation."

    "I just shrugged while telling him \"You dragged me into this, handle it yourself!\" in body language."

    r "You were spying on us?"

    r "Are we really that interesting? Who are you even?"

    waitress "Of course you're interesting. I thought that maybe you were the ones I've been looking forever for and since I really hate this job it would have been nice to-"

    waitress "Ah! No more words!"
    "We both raised a brow at this weirdo."

    waitress "Sigh... I might as well ask to be sure."

    r "If you're going to ask us something then do it now. Do you want to know how the food was or something?"

    waitress "Ah, no! Nothing of that sort."

    waitress "This is a really weird question to ask so just ignore me if it sounds... Really weird."

    r "Just spit it out."

    waitress "Of course!"

    waitress "Did anything really... Uh... Anything special happen in your life?"
    waitress "Kind of like... You suddenly are someone else or something?"

    "Again, we both looked at each other, this time with wide open eyes."
    "This was the first stranger to ever ask a question like this to us, so there was no way she wasn't involved in our swap in some way."

    mc "How did you-"

    r "That is a question that could mean a lot of things, so specify."

    mc "What? MC, she is asking us if-"

    r "Shut it."

    "His serious glare meant that I was screwing up."

    "I realized soon after that trusting someone like this probably wouldn't be the best idea."
    "Just because she knew about the swap, wouldn't mean that she wants to help us or anything."

    waitress "Um... Well, you see, I work at a... Special place, where we do work to help people like that, without revealing too much that I can't tell."

    waitress "I've been looking for people like that here, since we know for certain that three people like that exist here, but I could never find two of these people."

    think "Three people?"

    think "But with me and MC, it's only two who were swapped."
    think "And how does someone even swap bodies with... Nobody else?"

    think "Or is she telling me that MC wasn't originally Rumi...?"
    think "Yeah, no way that can be true."

    "It was clear that he was confused too, but he still had a more relaxed expression now."

    r "And by help, you mean...?"

    waitress "{i}Sigh...{/i} We give people the opportunity to undo it. I don't know how else to be less specific."

    r "...In that case, yes, we are likely to be part of that group of people you're looking for."

    waitress "Really?!"

    waitress "Yes!"

    r "You're talking about people that had their personalities switched, correct?"

    waitress "Oh god, yes! That's exactly what it is!"

    "Her face was gleaming with joy. I wondered just how long she had been looking for us."

    waitress "If it's really true then I can report back!"

    waitress "Which also means, I can finally do this!"

    mc "Don't tell me you're actually-"

    waitress "An angel? Yup!"

    waitress "Hee-hee."
    "She smirked as if she had been anticipating to reveal her true self."

    r "What the hell is this? Do you seriously think we'd believe that?"

    waitress "Oh! Right, most humans don't really believe angels exist anymore."

    waitress "That kind of ruins the reveal..."

    mc "Wait, so can you for real fly?"

    r "The hell do you mean \"fly\"? It's a trick! Don't tell me you actually think this is real."

    mc "Dude, why are you so riled up if you think she isn't the real deal..."

    r "I'm not at all riled up- I mean, obviously angels aren't real, and you're an idiot for thinking so!"

    mc "Sorry, what's your name again?"

    waitress "Josephine, 9th generation messenger angel of the high heavens."

    mc "Alright, can I call your Josephine?"
    waitress "Of course."

    mc "Alright, Josephine. I think he might be doubting whether you're real or not, so can you just levitate a bit or something? At least it would be confirmation for me as well."

    r "I'm not doubting anything! I'm sure!"

    mc "Right."

    waitress "Sure."

    "Without much effort, she started hovering over the ground."

    waitress "See?"

    r "As if that proves anythi-"

    mc "MC, we both had our bodies swapped. Angels being real is a very minor side-dish to that fact."
    r "..."

    r "Urgh, fine. You're an angel, whatever."

    waitress "Hee-hee."

    r "Now wipe that smirk of your face and stop making it so freaking chilly around here with all that wind."

    waitress "Oh! I'm sorry!"

    "She landed and bowed to signify her apology."

    mc "You said you can swap us back?"

    waitress "Yes, yes. It takes a bit of time since it's new technology, even for us, but we've helped a lot of people already!"

    r "So we just go back to their normal lives and pretend as if nothing had happened?"

    waitress "Exactly! We have the power to make it a seamless process. You won't even know you swapped if you would like that."

    r "...Hm, I don't know..."

    mc "I'm in the same boat, this sounds a little... You know..."

    waitress "Fishy? We can let you talk with people who we've helped before if you don't trust us, so you don't have to worry about user reviews!"

    r "User reviews? Wha- No, that's not what we meant."

    r "I'm happy with my life right now. Another swap would be extremely unnecessary and just complicate things."

    mc "Yeah."

    waitress "Huh? You don't want to go back?"

    waitress "How did you guys even meet in the first place?"
    mc "...School?"

    r "High school."
    waitress "Oh, wow. You both went to school together and were swapped?"

    waitress "You guys are lucky."

    waitress "I guess that's why you're okay with it then."

    r "How is this lucky? We worked hard towards the outcome together."
    r "If anything we were lucky to turn this mess of ours into something positive."

    mc "Agreed."

    waitress "Uh... To each their own I suppose."

    waitress "But you are certain you don't want to go back to your original bodies then?"

    r "Of course. We've already talked about this."

    r "We both agreed that if we ever were to be put into a situation where we could choose to undo everything, we'd both say no."

    mc "Yep."

    r "We did that a long time ago. To just go back and act as if everything was normal would be terrible."

    waitress "Ah. I see. Then this has also managed to make some people happy. That is a relief."

    pg "{size=-5}Rumi?! MC?! Are you guys out here?!{/size}"
    think "Ah, they must be long done saying their farewells inside by now."

    waitress "Oh, and uh, don't tell anyone else I exist, please. I think my boss doesn't want everyone to know that I'm an angel and everything... You know."

    r "We've been keeping a bigger secret like that throughout half our lives. Our lips are sealed."

    waitress "Thank you so much."

    waitress "In the name of Nero the Holy, I wish you both farewell and the best."
    waitress "And if you ever meet a being called Joseph, please make sure to greet him for me."

    "With that, she was gone."
    r "She dead-ass just flew away. Wow."

    r "Someone like her probably waited for an opportunity to take a leave like that."

    mc "Heh."

    "Still, we just met an actual angel. What the hell? Did that mean religion was real?"

    think "\"Sandra Bloom (28) describes her recent years of panic and anxiety, as she believes herself to be born as someone else entirely. In her past, she claims to have been Zendaya Uduike, and despite never having shown interest in African culture, manages to speak fluent Swahli and knows many other customs and locations. Her story is chilling, to the point where one could wonder if there is a grain of truth in it.\""

    pg "People thought that girl had freaking died!"

    "I was bad at remembering people, but after thinking about it, I remembered everything here."
    "She was one of Kat's best friends."
    "She suddenly stopped coming to school because of some incident."

    "I remembered how Kat explained the situation back then."

    "It made too much sense now. The newspaper might doubt it, but reading it in context of our swap and her sudden insanity, it had to be true."

    r "Rumi, calm down."
    r "The girl says she is living a good life at the end if that worries you."

    pg "You took the words right out of my mouth."
    "Luckily they didn't get mad at me for not sharing it with them."
    "After telling them the story, it helped them understand just how fucked up this girl's situation must have been after having been swapped."

    r "Even if it was you, I can't imagine how screwed my life would be if I swapped with someone across the globe, assuming what happened to her was the exact same as what happened to us..."

    r "Especially from a dump like Africa."

    pg "But what happened to the real Sandra then?"

    mc "I was wondering that too."

    r "Right... About that."

    r "I really suck at being empathetic, so I don't really know how to say it in a way that isn't going to freak you out, but..."
    r "She is probably dead."

    "PG gasped and put her hands around her mouth."
    mc "It... It says in the article?"

    r "At the end, yeah."
    r "In short she told them that in her previous life, or body, whatever, she was about to starve to death and probably would have died with another few days..."

    mc "..."

    mc "I think I get why we were lucky then..."

    r "I thought back to those words too. That girl we met must have known about Sandra."

    r "But doesn't this just confirm the most fucked up thing? The thing we thought about after talking to her?"

    mc "That we weren't the only ones?"
    r "Exactly. In just our little city, three people had this happen to them. Imagine how many people this has happened to worldwide!"

    r "We weren't targeted at all. We just... Happened to be in the crossfire or were collateral or something..."

    r "I don't know... I don't really want to dig deeper either..."
    r "Without that girl's help, we probably would never have been able to swap back to begin with. So everything we did was completely pointless."
    mc "...This really is kind of screwed up. So there are probably many others like us out there then."

    pg "Wh- Who is \"that girl\"?"

    r "Uh... Can't say, sorry."

    "PG raised a brow, but didn't look further into it."

    r "But really, it does make me curious. What on earth really happened back then to cause all of this..."
