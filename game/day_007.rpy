    think "Ugh, why do the neighbors have a freaking rooster of all things..."

    "It was that bliss time of the week where I could just stay in my bed half-asleep, despite Gunnar the Rooster from next door screaming his lungs out."

    "Sundays were the best, especially if you spent a lot of time just gaming into midnight last day."

    think "I'm sure PG can be proud of the fact that I finally unlocked hard-mode in Tetris."

    think "..."
    think "Right, I made the stupid decision to promise going on this date thing."
    mc "{i}Sigh...{/i}"

    think "Glasses, glasses, where art thou."

    think "There you are."

    $ screenfilter.blur = 0

    think "That's better."

    think "Man, I would've loved sleeping until like twelve into noon, but Rumi told me I had to get up as early as possible."
    think "..."

    think "I should probably get up before she ambushes me while I'm still lying here."

    "It was a bit of a hassle since anyone without a key wouldn't even be able to get into this massive complex of a building."

    "I opened the gate for her and..."

    r "Took you long enough."

    m "I knew it, you totally were going to be with this girl today! You shouldn't just lie to girls like that!"

    mc "..."

    mc "What the hell are they doing here?"

    "That blonde girl that kept looking at me during lunch last day are with her."

    r "Not my fault that this annoying girl doesn't want to leave me alone."

    m "We both agreed we would be going to hang out today."

    r "Did not!"

    mc "Wait, you're bringing her to the mixer?"

    m "The mixer? What is that?"

    r "She is only staying until we're done preparing {i}you alone to go to the aforementioned thing{/i}."

    mc "...Uh... Am I supposed to agree with what you're sayi-"

    mc "Ah, I mean, yes, {i}I am the only one going to this thing{/i}...?"

    r "{i}Exactly{/i}."

    m "...What are you guys even talking about?"

    r "Not something you have to know."

    r "Anyways, I'm not here to chat about useless stuff. You bought the things I told you right?"
    "Without much of a warning, she just walked through the door as if she owned the place and expected me to follow."

    "And that girl followed her almost immediately, and I still had no idea who the hell she was or what she was even doing here."

    mc "I didn't find the exact shampoo you told me to buy but I found something similar."

    r "That's fine. As long as the eyeliner and lipstick are the exact same."

    mc "...Do you really want me to actually wear that stuff?"

    m "You don't use eyeliner normally?"

    r "Yes she does, and yes, I do want you to wear it."

    r "Now. Let's get down to business"

    "She walked up to the fridge, opened it, and found a can of soda that had been lying around for god knows how long."

    r "Here. Me and Rumi have to talk in private for a bit, so go into the living room and watch some TV while you wait."

    "She handed the blonde the soda, to which the girl smiled."

    m "Sure!"

    m "But I want to join in on applying her make-up."

    r "Yeah yeah, scram."

    "The girl left the kitchen and closed the door behind her."

    mc "...Care to explain?"

    r "I can't get rid of her."

    mc "You can't get rid of her? Why is she following you in the first place?"

    r "She just... Came up to me and told me she liked me and now I'm stuck with her."

    mc "...So you're saying that within two weeks, you've managed to get some freshman to fanatically like me. For no reason."
    r "Who cares about it? We don't have a lot of time so we need to start doing the make-up and hair."

    mc "I still don't get why she is suddenly attached to you like Carrie, I mean, it really reeks like you're hiding someth-"

    r "I said, who cares!"

    think "She is totally hiding something."

    mc "Who even is she?"

    r "...{i}Sigh...{/i} Her name is May and she is Mike's sister."

    mc "Huh..."

    mc "Wait, Mike has a sister?! That Mike?!"

    r "Yes, that Mike. And she agreed to leave me alone for the rest of the day if she could help out with this, so just, don't question why she's here and everything will be fine."

    r "Got that drilled into your brain?"

    mc "Yes, sir."

    think "I was curious what on earth made her stick to Rumi in the first place, but it doesnt't seem like she wants to talk about it."

    r "We're done talking. If you want to do this then get off your ass and follow us."

    m "Huh? Oh that was fast. Sure."
    think "Seriously, why does this girl even want to be in a 100 meter radius of Rumi if this is how she treats her..."

    r "The face cream."

    m "Uh... What drawer?"
    r "Third from the top on the right."

    m "Oh, okay."

    think "..."

    think "I feel like a doll that's being pampered right now..."

    m "Here you go."

    "Rumi was concentrated on putting all kinds of chemicals on my face in the right way."

    "It just... I don't know, looked weird to see my own body applying stuff to Rumi's face, while I had control of Rumi's face and all."

    "I had looked at myself in the mirror plenty of times during these last two weeks, but this was still bizarre. My face was full of some weird cream she smeared around for the 4th time now."

    m "Do you guys do this often?"

    r "Often? Uh..."

    mc "N- No, MC just... Likes to practice for the future, heh, right?"

    r "Uh, yeah, sure."

    m "Ooh, you want to be some kind of make-up stylist or whatcha call it?"

    r "Uhm, yeah, that."
    "It was only for a brief moment, but Rumi actually nodded in approval to me in the mirror. Almost as if telling me {q}good job{/q}."
    "It almost felt fulfilling having this girl approve of my genius lie."

    mc "But don't, you know, tell anyone. It's a secret."

    m "My lips are sealed."

    r "Good. Now wait 15 minutes for the cream to sink in, then wash your face afterwards."
    r "After that you can take a bath while I fix your hair and then we do the final touches."

    mc "Uh... Sounds good."

    m "Ahaha, he said he is going to do your hair while you're taking a dip in the water and you're just okay with that?"

    m "You're so weird. "

    r "..."

    think "Wait, did she actually say that?"

    r "I'm just gonna go make a call real quick."

    "She leaned down right next to my ear and started whispering to me."

    r "{size=-8}This is taking too long and I have to do this while you're washing yourself or we're going to be late, so I'm getting this brat away from here with my plan B.{/size}"

    m "Huh?"

    mc "Hey, hey, hey..."

    mc "You're not serious right?"

    "She ignored me and got out her phone (well, it's actually my phone but whatever)."

    m "What did he tell you?"

    mc "Uh... Nothing..."

    m "..."

    m "You like him too, right? You can't hide that, you guys are way too close."

    mc "W- What? Like him? Me?"

    m "Heck yeah. But I'll let you know, he confessed to me, not you. And I bet you told him to text me what he did."

    m "But I don't give up that easily!"

    mc "What?! He confessed to you? What the hell are you talking about?"

    m "Hmpf, so he didn't tell you."

    m "But yeah, that's right. I'm still trying to figure out why he would suddenly back out again, but even someone who has the guts to do that as a prank is someone I think is really cool."

    mc "Ba- Back up, are you serious? Confessed, like in, tell you he likes you?"
    m "Of course."

    mc "Wha- Why would she do tha-"

    "As I was trying to figure out what the heck she was saying, Rumi walked back into the bathroom with a smile on her face."

    mc "...What did you do now?"

    r "What do you mean by that?"

    mc "You have a smile on your face, that's not a good sign."
    r "Rude."

    r "Anyways, I'm {i}so sorry{/i} May, but it seems like Mike has business with you and is here in a minute to pick you up, so sadly we will have to part ways now."

    m "Why would Mike come here all of a sudden?"
    m "Why do you even know he's coming?"

    r "Oh, he called me."

    m "But didn't you just walk out to make a ca-"
    m "Oh come on!"
    m "I just want to spend time with you!"

    r "Well, boo-hoo, life is unfair."

    think "Man, it gives an entirely different take on her character if she is being nefarious and it affects yourself positively as a result..."
    think "She just doesn't give a crap about May's feelings at all."

    m "...Fine."

    m "But I'm not giving him up to you yet."

    mc "Uh... Sure..."

    think "I don't know if I'm supposed to be happy that Rumi has made some random girl fall this hard for me or if I should be angry."

    think "Still, confessed to her? Why on earth would she do that?"

    r "Alright, she's finally gone."

    r "Geez was she annoying."

    mc "Right..."

    mc "About what she to-"

    r "Now get your ass up and wash your face, 15 minutes have long passed. I'm gonna go fill the bathtub and figure out how to fix your hair."

    mc "Were you serious when you said you're gonna do my hair while I'm..."

    r "While what? While you're in the tub? You're not supposed to get your hair wet right now anyways and we're running short on time, so yes, I am serious."

    mc "...You don't feel embarrassed at all about doing that...?"

    r "...About seeing myself naked?"

    mc "Yeah, that..."

    r "I've literally grown up with that body, why the hell would I be embarrassed looking at it?"
    mc "..."
    "Man, I thought she would feel just a little bit like me, but for some reason it felt... Just wrong to let her see me without any clothes on."
    "Was I just being weird? Or was the swap affecting me here too?"
    "This is weird..."

    mc "So, we done with the dress-up?"

    r "Yep. You finally look like me again."

    mc "Do I really need to wear contacts though? They are annoying to wear."
    r "Yes, you do."

    r "As we agreed, you can wear those shitty glasses again once we're done, but you better not embarrass me in front of the other people or I'm retracting the deal!"

    mc "Yeah, yeah, fine by me."

    "After what felt like hours of being baked with what had to be ten different beauty products, I was finally deemed ready to get this thing over with."

    "Rumi had somehow arranged this unfathomably quickly and rented some really cliche karaoke room for four."

    "So I assumed it was going to be a two girls two boys situation, which would feel extremely awkward since I'd {i}have{/i} to interact with us being only four."
    r "And you know exactly how to act, right?"

    mc "Yeah yeah, girly, legs closed, laugh at jokes that aren't funny..."

    r "And make sure not to spill food."

    mc "And that."

    mc "Shouldn't I actually be giving you demands on how to act too?"

    r "Oh come on, anything I do would be a better option than what you would do."

    mc "Didn't you say that you got nervous around girls?"

    r "I know how to deal with it now."

    mc "Actually, that reminds me, that May girl mentioned something..."

    r "Mentioned what?"
    mc "Something about you confessing to her."

    "Her face went red in an instant as she looked away."

    think "Could you make it more obvious that you did something stupid?"

    mc "Not like I'm going to complain about you somehow ending up scoring me a girlfriend or something..."

    mc "Besides, she's being annoying to {i}you{/i} right now so I really have no idea what you were thinking."

    r "Shut up, okay?!"

    mc "Geez, touchy subject or something?"

    "It was probably something I would have digged further into to get my satisfaction of annoying her a bit, but with this mixer thing coming up I figured that I probably shouldn't tempt the devil."

    #scene karaoke

    "We arrived at the locale, which was kind of cozy looking."
    "We were just in time, with a minute to spare, but there was nobody else in sight here yet."

    "Time ran with us just sitting around for five minutes. I couldn't really be bothered striking up something to talk with Rumi about, and evidently, neither could she."

    r "{size=-7}Where the hell are they...{/size}"

    think "At least I know who is the more patient one of us two..."

    "After ten minutes in total, two people entered the room."

    "Rumi lit up from her grumpy mood immediately as if nothing were ever wrong and greeted them."

    r "Hello. Great to meet both of you. Dominic and Audrey, I believe it was?"
    audrey "Hey. We're so sorry about the delay."

    dominic "Yeah, hey, the train was delayed so we had to run our pants off, heh."

    r "Ah, public transport. I totally get what you went through, haha."

    think "Uh... Has she ever even taken public transport?"

    think "Don't tell me she is going to lie all throughout the day."
    r "As you guys already know, my name is MC, and this lady over here is Rumi, the one I talked to you about."

    mc "Oh, yeah, hi."
    "I waved my hand as we introduced ourselves."

    dominic "I'm Dominic, glad to meet you."

    audrey "And I'm Audrey."

    mc "Ah, cool meeting you guys."

    dominic "Pleasure is all ours."

    "He smiled gently at me, but in the corner of my eye I could feel Rumi feeling physical disgust."

    "This Dominic guy seemed like a normal guy, so why she'd react like that was really beyond me."

    think "But then again, this is Rumi we are talking about."

    "It went more smoothly than I thought it would. Rumi was practically leading the conversation with me just nodding."

    "Oh, and the magic trick of faking a small smile or laugh when the others said something that was supposed to be funny."

    "Which quickly became very tiring to do."

    r "Actually, I was wondering, do you guys know each other already?"

    dominic "Heh, you guessed right. We are actually both working under an apprenticeship as waiters."

    r "You can have an apprenticeship as a waiter?"

    dominic "Yep. We both work at cafes that are practically right next to each other."

    audrey "And we've been friends since pre-school, so it was kinda funny that we ended up both wanting to do the same thing when we grow up and then even ended up in neighboring shops."

    think "Huh, seems weird to me that they haven't gotten together themselves yet if they have such matching interests. They look like the perfect match."

    r "Huh, shouldn't you guys have gotten together yourselves yet if you have such matching interests? You really look like you'd be the perfect match for each other already."

    think "...What, she can read minds now too?"

    audrey "Hehe, we get that a lot. But we both agreed that we would rather want to be rivals and co-workers in the future if everything goes well."

    dominic "And I wouldn't survive a day with Drey's famous frisbee tray flying everywhere around the house."

    audrey "That has only happened three times."

    think "Nah, I take back everything I said before. These guys are {i}too much{/i} of a match."

    "Rumi let out a long sigh while Audrey and Dominic were bickering and laughing over what appears to be misfortunes that happened during the job."

    mc "{size=-5}I'm supposed to feel flustered about Dominic, right?{/size}"

    "I almost thought she wouldn't answer since the banter the other two were doing was starting to cool off, but eventually she did respond."

    r "{size=-5}Yes, but these guys are so basic.{/size}"

    mc "{size=-5}Basic?{/size}"

    r "Aaa~~~anyhow, let's do something. I rented this karaoke room for a reason after all."

    audrey "Heh, we are going to hear you sing?"

    r "I'll show you what a future star sounds like, just you watch."

    "The karaoke actually turned out to be quite fun."

    "I hadn't considered singing with Rumi's voice before, but it was actually... Really good."

    "Well, her on the other hand..."

    r "{size=-8}I can't sing... This body can't sing...{/size}"

    "I felt just a tiny bit bad for apparently robbing her of her talent to hit notes, since I knew that I was terrible at it with my actual body."
    "Turns out that the talent of being terrible at singing doesn't carry over when you swap with someone."

    think "But isn't she is having just a bit too much of an existential crisis right now?"

    dominic "You know, I'd pay a pretty penny if you were a performer at a party or something."

    audrey "U-huh!"

    mc "Heh, well, maybe it's a possibility for the future."

    audrey "Hey, hey, can I do this one with you as well?"
    "She pointed towards some song I knew. {q}Don't start unbelieving{/q}."

    think "What a classic."

    dominic "We're in for a treat now."

    dominic "You know, Audrey actually performs on stage sometimes."

    mc "What? Really? That's amazing!"

    audrey "Don't up-play me like that Dom, I only experimented a little once or twice doing it."

    dominic "I could invite you to the next time she does her gig if you're up for it."

    mc "Heh, uh... Maybe."

    think "Crap, is this guy already asking me out for another event?!"
    think "How do I even turn him down? I don't want to go out with a dude!"

    "While I had a mild internal panic attack, Audrey turned on the track which brought me back to reality just a bit."

    think "I probably have to tell him I don't want to meet him again at some point, right?"
    think "But I need to say it in some sort of gentle way to not hurt him..."

    think "ARGH! Why am I thinking about this like that?!"

    r "What, not gonna sing with your beautiful and talented voice...?"

    think "Oh, right, the song."
    "But the way Rumi said that to me was the most monotone way possible."

    "She clearly had nothing but spite and jealousy towards me for stealing her spotlight."

    think "Sorry, heh."

    #ellipse
    #bathroom

    "Me and Rumi had excused ourselves out of the room under the pretense to go get something to drink."
    "Mostly because Rumi heavily insisted on us doing that for them."
    "But I can imagine that her thirst wasn't the reason for wanting to go out of the room for a minute."

    r "Those guys are so fucking lame!"

    mc "What? Why?"

    r "Don't you see it? They are clearly already buddy-buddy with each other and are just finding excuses not to fuck already because they are too scared about what the other one would say!"

    r "This entire thing is so freaking pointless, how am I supposed to get turned on by someone who is already in the pants of someone else?!"

    mc "Whoah, whoah, calm down."

    mc "They might hear you, you know..."

    r "Urgh, I spent money on this for nothing."

    mc "So... You don't think Audrey is attractive or something?"

    r "I mean, sure, she's cute and would probably make for a great girlfr-"

    r "Oooh fuck no what am I saying?!"

    r "She's average!"

    mc "{i}Sigh...{/i} Okay, so you're having another one of your anger fits."

    r "It's not-"

    r "Argh! Fine!"

    mc "...What's fine?"

    r "That I'm pissed! I get it, I was supposed to figure out if I turned lesbian and obviously I am!"

    r "But what about you? You think that joke of a man is worth anything?"

    mc "Uhm... Well..."

    think "I guess I looked at him in a bit of a different light...?"
    think "I mean, if he asked me out on a date while I was still a guy then I'd still try to politely tell him something like {q}Whoah, back off{/q} in order to not hurt his feelings too much..."

    mc "It's... Uh... Kind of complicated I think."

    r "What about the girl? You seemed all giddy-giddy being able to sing with her without holding back."
    r "No perv thoughts at all?"

    mc "I guess not...?"

    r "You didn't even notice how you managed to ram her tits a couple times while you were so caught up in using {i}my voice{/i} for your own fun?"

    mc "Wait, I did?!"

    think "Hell, I didn't even notice that. I just went with the flow, Audrey was pretty much a natural born performer which I tried to mirror for fun."

    r "I really hope for your own sake that you aren't naturally gay."

    mc "I didn't do that on purpose!"

    mc "And I'm sorry that I suck at singing..."

    r "You better be."

    "We brought the refreshments to the other two and ended up staying for another hour or so before finally deciding to end the day there."

    "About three and a half hours had passed with them, and I had both their numbers registered on my phone now."

    "This entire thing actually went completely different to what my expectations were. I thought this would have been some kind of date where we'd end up kissing or some crap, but it was actually pretty enjoyable."

    "Well, for one of us at least."

    mc "You're still angry about today?"

    r "Oh no, mc, I am actually so freaking happy right now. You ended up having loads of fun hanging out with that bitch while I was stuck talking with the other guy about how he tuned his motorbike."

    r "Just a splendid time."

    mc "...I'll take that as a yes."

    r "{i}Sigh...{/i} It's just frustrating..."

    mc "..."

    mc "You... Uh, want to stay a bit longer at your own house? Your parents probably won't be home until ten or so as usual."
    r "It's fine. Your mom was going to make me pancakes today."

    mc "Oh, right..."

    "In that moment I decided that I would be making pancakes myself today."

    #scene street

    mc "Well, see you tomorrow then."
    r "Yeah yeah."
    r "And don't forget to read the links to those stories I sent you."

    mc "Will do."

    "She went her own way without looking back, but did wave a hand in the air briefly when we got to the crossing where the roads home forked."

    think "Huh, she even said {q}see you{/q} in her own roundabout way."
    "Today really was weird. Rumi seemed to tolerate me at the end there. A real world first."
    mc "Hm, maybe things are starting to look better between us, somehow."
