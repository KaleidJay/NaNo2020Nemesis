    "When there was nobody else in sight, she released her grip from our clothes and stood in place for a few seconds."

    pg "What are you two doing?!"

    mc "Wha-"

    pg "You are both making us look like complete idiots!"

    r "I am making us look like idiots?! Look at this dickhead who is making me look like one alre-"

    pg "Don't you think I've told him how absolutely stupid he is already for doing this?!"
    pg "Do you really think telling him to go fuck himself is going to change anything?!"

    r "Wh- Why are you talking back to me?!"
    "This guy was just grinning because PG of all fucking people dared to talk to me like a superior or something."

    think "I swear, when we swap back..."

    pg "Can you guys just, for once, not argue in front of each other?"

    r "How am I supposed to-"

    pg "Hey!"

    pg "Don't say another word!"

    r "You- But- "

    r "{b}{i}ARGH!{/i}{/b}"

    think "Fuck!"

    think "I know she's right, keeping up this bullshit is only going to make me look like an equal to that idiot."

    "He himself looked content being able to get away without anything happening though..."

    think "I need my payback on this, and I'm so going to get it soon, just you wait."
    pg "Are we fine?"
    r "Urgh, yes! Fine! Do whatever you want!"

    mc "I was fine from the beginning."

    r "You-"

    pg "Good! Then we're all going to our classes. Alright?"

    r "...Alright, fine."

    mc "Sure."

    "I felt a bit calmer now, maybe PG talking back turned out to be the best for me."
    "Before leaving, I got a glimpse of his face. He smiled, clearly enjoying seeing me beaten."

    "I knew that this was his own pathetic way of getting payback at me for using that stupid dye on his hair. I need to figure out some way to get at him that would hit him good."

    mc "See you at lunch then...?"

    r "{size=-5}Whatever.{/size}"

    pg "...Sigh..."

    #scene lunch

    r "So, any ideas?"

    pg "Really, do you think it's a good idea to do anything...?"

    pg "I mean, it would just end up becoming a loop of both of you wanting payback..."

    r "No, I need it. I cannot live knowing that that moron is able to pose around as me with those clothes."
    pg "I guess as long as we keep an eye on him to make sure he doesn't do something stupid..."

    "Normally, I would consult everyone at my former table to figure out some way to really put someone back into their place somehow."
    "If people annoyed me to no end, they would end up facing me and my group unless they kissed my feet."

    "But things were different now. mc was wearing my face and the only help I had was Corny."

    "And, well, Weeb, who was currently somehow reading something on his phone while also eating lunch."

    pg "Well, got anything in mind?"

    r "I need something that degrades him even further than where he already is."
    r "Something that he wouldn't notice so that he doesn't get the idea to do the same thing to me."

    r "I don't know. I already fucked up his friendship, so..."

    pg "You want to neuter yourself...? While in his body?"

    r "What?! No!"

    r "Don't joke about that, I'm not... Doing that!"

    "I took a bite out of my sandwich and thought about hard it."
    r "I don't know, I don't typically ruin my reputation with girls as a guy."

    pg "Ah, so that's what you want to do."

    pg "Uh... Maybe you could wear some weird clothes too...?"

    r "Nah, that's too obvious. I need the reputation gone, not just something that might attract someone else."
    r "Hmm... If there was something I could get inspiration from, this would be much easier."

    r "Do we even have examples of someone in this school who all girls just, like, hate?"

    pg "Hmm..."
    "..."

    "...!"

    "As if having the exact same thought, we both looked at the guy sitting at our table peacefully reading."

    "Both of us looked at him in silence and then turned to each other."
    r "Oh!"

    pg "We have the greatest weapon right here!"

    "He noticed us both staring at him after a while and looked at us with a confused look."

    weeb "...Huh?"

    r "You!"

    weeb "...Me?"

    r "Tell us how you act around girls!"
    weeb "Wh-"
    "He looked as if he had just seen a ghost or something."

    weeb "Act around girls? Could it perhaps be that you want to entrap the heart of a woman just like I do?"

    r "Uh... Yeah, whatever you just said."

    weeb "Oh no. Could it be that you truly are lesbian?"

    r "Wha- No! I just need to give MC some payback by having all girls see him like they see you, you kno-"

    pg "Hey, don't tell him the plan! He sides with him after all!"

    weeb "Ah, you want to pay back MC's misdoings against you by making him a favor? How wholehearted of you."

    r "...Yeah, that."

    weeb "Could this perhaps be a part of my training then?"

    think "His training...?"

    think "Oh yeah, I did promise him to {i}flirt better{/i} or something..."

    r "Uh, yes, I want to try out how you approach girls first, you know."

    pg "What is this {q}training{/q} I just heard about?"

    weeb "My dear Rumi has promised me to learn how to approach girls properly, as it seems my previous attempts have been fruitless."

    pg "Pfft, really?"

    pg "You're gonna teach him how to talk with girls?"

    "Man, this bitch was giggling to herself because of that stupid promise."
    "She sure had a mind of her own now that she was spending time with mc, huh?"

    pg "But honestly, you must have done something crazy to him. I know you're a guy for the time being, but he is like, not even paying attention to me."

    pg "Kind of like a tamed animal if you ask me, haha."

    think "Huh, she is actually kind of right."
    think "Normally he'd be all over any girl he sees."

    weeb "What do you mean?"

    r "She means that it's weird that you're not trying to get into her pants."

    pg "H- Hey! Don't even try to make me imagine that picture in my head!"

    weeb "Why would I want to go out with her?"
    "..."

    pg "...What?"

    think "He just said something weird."

    weeb "I mean, you aren't exactly girlfriend material."

    pg "..."

    pg "{size=+5}...WHAT?!{/size}"

    r "Pffftt..."

    r "Aa~~~~ahahahaha..."

    r "Oh my god, for real?"

    pg "Hey! Don't laugh at that!"

    pg "And what do you mean I'm not {q}girlfriend material{/q}?!"

    weeb "According to {q}Weeb's Womanly Exam{/q}, pg lacks the following."
    weeb "Strike one: She is unusually flat."

    weeb "Strike two: Her personality is quite shallow and from observations, not very feminine."

    pg "Wh- Wai-"

    weeb "Strike three: Too short. Although it is important that the height does not exceed the Weeb, the girl must be at least able to see above high quality kitchen counters."

    "PG had a face of absolute terror on her. There was no stopping this, the number one perv of the school was saying that she, of all people, wasn't good enough for him."

    weeb "Strike four: The examinee is not in the least attracti-"

    pg "{b}STOP! OH MY GOD, STOP!{/b}"

    weeb "Huh? What's wrong?"

    pg "What's wrong?! Are you kidding me?! You've been hitting on me {i}EVERY TIME{/i} I see you, and now you're telling me I'm ugly!"

    r "-ahahah, yeah, that's kinda true, actually..."

    weeb "Of course I would, you were with the lovely Rumi after all."

    pg "...Wait, so you're saying that every time you were hitting on us, you were only hitting on Rumi?"

    weeb "Of course. Wasn't that clear?"

    pg "What?!"

    "This was so hilarious, so much that I slammed the table with my hand in sheer laughter."

    pg "I absolutely {i}refuse{/i} to accept that you, of all people, are telling me that!"

    pg "You don't realize there is a charm to smaller girls?!"

    weeb "Charm? There is no charm about that. There needs to be something else, and I do not see that in you."

    pg "Wha- Why- You..."

    r "-ahahah, this is killing me..."

    pg "He- Hey, stop l- Laughing!"

    "Weeb's confused look just made this so much better, but knowing that lunchtime wouldn't last forever, I finally managed to get a grip on myself again."

    think "Although this probably is one of the funniest things I could ever think of."

    r "Oh- Okay, but really, tell us what it is you do whenever you try to talk with girls."

    weeb "{i}So, first of all, you must find your target. Ideally, try to approach her in seclusion.{/i}"

    r "{i}Seclusion...? Really?{/i}"

    weeb "{i}Anything wrong?{/i}"

    r "{i}It just sounds so fucking creepy when you say it like that.{/i}"

    weeb "{i}Uh, well... Approach her while she is alone, then?{/i}"

    r "{i}I don't think it gets better now that you've imprinted that word into my brain.{/i}"
    weeb "{i}Uh...{/i}"
    "He discreetly cleared his throat before continuing."

    weeb "{i}First of all, declare that your heart is hers!{/i}"

    "Heh, the plan was simple. Go and ask loads of girls out and get rejected in order to start rumors of mc confessing to {i}everyone{/i}."
    "As long as I was him, I didn't want to be ostracized by everyone, so acting exactly like Weeb was out of the question."
    "But that didn't mean that I couldn't give off the aura of some creep who wanted every girl he sees."
    "I had basically prepared for every situation right now, and if I prepare for something, things {i}never{/i} go south."

    m "So, what's up?"
    "This was May, Mike's sister who just recently started going here as a freshman."

    "Since she was Mike's sister, I knew she would be among the popular girls, even if she looked a bit... Uh, childish, I guess."

    "Which also means that having her start rumors among freshmen she's sure to impress would result in a bingo for me."

    think "Alright, Weeb-gameface on."

    r "You know, I've noticed you."

    m "...Huh?"

    r "Amongst all the... New girls, you stand out to me."

    m "..."

    m "....Huh?"

    think "She's completely dumb-founded..."
    think "Guess Weeb's moves really do completely alienate every girl he talks to."

    r "Would you please go out with me?"

    m "...S- Seriously?!"

    r "It would be my, uh... Utmost pleasure, I think... And-"

    m "Okay, sure."
    r "-it would pain my hea-"

    r "{b}What?{/b}"

    m "I know a really good place we could go eat something! You like burgers, right?"

    r "Uh... S- Sure...?"

    m "You want to go this Sunday at twelve? It comes as a bit of a surprise that one of Mike's friends likes me, but this sounds exciting."

    think "What the hell are those puppy eyes?! Why can't I just-"

    r "No- I mean- Y- Yeah, why not, I guess...?"

    m "Cool, talk to you later then!"

    #make her leave

    think "..."

    r "{size=-5}What the fuck...?!{/size}"

    think "O- Okay, that was just one girl who seemed to accept anyone, hah, nothing to worry about, I can just... Tell her it was a joke later on..."

    r "{i}So, what, you just tell someone you love them?{/i}"

    weeb "{i}Exactly.{/i}"

    r "{i}That's exactly the same advice you gave me just earlier! How is telling someone you love them and telling someone that your heart is theirs any different?!{/i}"

    weeb "{i}Most importantly, convey your feelings in a most romantic way.{/i}"
    weeb "{i}The way to a woman's heart is to make her understand that no matter what, she can rely on you and you alone!{/i}"

    "Alright, talking with a freshman who didn't know better was a mistake."
    "This time, I wasn't going to fool around with people I didn't know."
    "Once word spread that I had confessed to two people at the same time, he would look like an absolute asshole anyways."

    #go back again to lunch

    think "Okay, get your fucking grip together."

    think "This one was just... Oddballs."

    think "Yeah, that's it. They are crazy to actually accept a confession from someone like MC."

    "Now, to the main dish. Popgirl."

    popgirl "So, uh... You wanted to talk?"
    "People think she is oh so innocent because of how clumsy and kind she is. But dig deeper into how she acts, and you'll quickly find that she isn't some goodie-two-shoes at all."
    "She's been asked out by more people than me even, and has coldly rejected everyone."
    "This time, I was sure to get someone who would reject me!"
    think "Also, no more Weeb talk! I'm doing this my own way now."

    r "I'll be honest, I like you. Alright?"

    r "I... Uh, would like you to go out with me...?"

    think "Wait, what the hell am I saying! I'm getting fucking embarrassed again! Why?!"

    popgirl "Oh... The others joked that you would... Uh, confess to me when you asked me to talk with you."

    popgirl "So this is kind of embarrassing."

    think "Alright! Finally someone who sees this guy as a massive joke!"

    popgirl "Uhm..."

    popgirl "But it doesn't really bother me that you tell me though."

    r "Ah, understanabl-"

    r "What."

    think "She doesn't actually..."

    popgirl "I think you're really cute and interesting, but I can't tell my friends about us if... You do want to go out with me."

    r "W- Wait, but you've rejected {i}so many{/i} people before! Why would you say yes to me? I'm boring as hell and can't do anything properly-"

    popgirl "But I like that. You seem really reliable and fun to hang out with."

    r "He- He does- I mean, I do?"

    popgirl "I do think that someone asked you to confess to me, maybe Rumi since you two talk to each other a lot right now."

    popgirl "And when your friends got mad at you last week I think something happened. So if you don't really like me then that's okay too."

    "She shifted in place as if... She really did like the situation she was in..."

    think "How is this even happening..."
    think "This entire thing was such a stupid idea!"

    popgirl "I know! We can exchange numbers if you'd like."

    popgirl "If you still want to go somewhere just us two alone then I would be very happy."

    r "You, uh... Really don't have to do that."

    popgirl "Non-sense. I do think you're cute. So if you ever change your mind, please tell me."

    "Without really being able to retaliate, I ended up adding her number, which I already knew, to mc's phone."
    "And for some reason, it kinda felt good?"

    "Don't tell me..."
