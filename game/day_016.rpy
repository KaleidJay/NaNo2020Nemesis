    "1 week later"

    pg "..."

    pg "...They aren't coming, are they?"

    weeb "Ah, it would appear so."

    pg "...What is Rumi even doing right now? I know that MC is doing that stupid {q}future plans interview{/q} or whatever they call it, but you guys have to do that tomorrow, not today."

    weeb "You must know that this interview can determine your future. After all, this is where you tell your teacher and education supervisor what you would like to do when you get older."

    pg "...Yeah, I kind of know what they do, I just opted not to spend 20 seconds explaining it."

    pg "I've already been in there, but thanks for explaining something I already knew."

    weeb "Oh. And my sweet Rumi was going to try out my swapping theory of using the school computers I believe."

    pg "...Computers? How does that make sense?"

    weeb "You see, in the recent piece of {i}modern literature{/i} I read, the two heroes trade bodies when their personal computer files are traded around."

    weeb "I suggested that perhaps the school has the neural network of each student downloaded with high-tech alien technology, and currently she is researching whether we should continue the pursuit of this theory."

    pg "...What?"

    weeb "Nevermind, some theories require you to have an excellent skill in thinking to grasp."

    pg "Are you saying I'm not smart enough to understand you?"

    weeb "Uh... No...?"

    pg "...Hmph, you better not get used to talking to me like that."

    "..."

    pg "...Man, this is boring."

    pg "I wish I could sit with some other girls..."

    weeb "Indeed, if I were to be accompanied at a table with a girl, I would at least expect someone of a higher standar-"

    pg "There! You did it again! You're saying I look terrible!"

    weeb "What? Not at all, I am just saying that your features are, uh... Inadequate for my tastes."

    pg "Is there really {i}nothing{/i} about me you even find slightly attractive?!"

    weeb "Well, I would need to think about it before I could give a definite answer."

    pg "You can't even think of anything from the top of your head?! Seriously?!"

    #show May walking

    pg "What about her? That girl that's always after Rumi. She is annoying and even smaller than me."

    weeb "Well..."
    pg "{q}Well{/q} what?"

    weeb "There is a certain charm to her. I cannot describe it. I believe that if Rumi hadn't tried her luck, I would have tried it myself."
    weeb "Having a girl try to fight for your affection all the time seems like something that happens to an antagonist of an epic story."

    pg "For real? Even her?"

    weeb "She would still be a second pick if uh... That helps."

    pg "...Seriously, weren't you supposed to get advice from Rumi on how to treat girls..."

    mc "{i}Hah... Hah... Hah...{/i} Rumi!"

    pg "Huh? MC? Why are you out of breath?"

    mc "Where the hell is Rumi?!"

    pg "What happened? Weren't you supposed to be doing that interview right now?"

    mc "Yes!"
    mc "And she filled out her own form for it and everything. But!"

    mc "What the hell does she mean with {i}{q}I want to be the loving wife of a billionaire in the future{/q}{/i}?!"
