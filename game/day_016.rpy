    weeb "Ah, it would appear so."

    pg "...What is Rumi even doing right now? I know that David is doing that stupid \"future plans interview\" or whatever they call it, but you guys have to do that tomorrow, not today."

    show weeb happy at two_right

    weeb "You must know that this interview can determine your future. After all, this is where you tell your teacher and education supervisor what you would like to do when you get older."

    pg "...Yeah, I kind of know what they do, I just opted not to spend 20 seconds explaining it."

    pg "I've already been in there, but thanks for explaining something I already knew."

    weeb "Oh. And my sweet Rumi was going to try out my swapping theory of using the school computers I believe."

    show pg think at two_left

    pg "...Computers? How does that make sense?"

    show weeb think at two_right

    weeb "You see, in the recent piece of {i}modern literature{/i} I read, the two heroes trade bodies when their personal computer files are traded around."

    weeb "I suggested that perhaps the school has the neural network of each student downloaded with high-tech alien technology, and currently she is researching whether we should continue the pursuit of this theory."

    show pg scared at two_left

    pg "...What?"

    show weeb happy at two_right

    weeb "Nevermind, some theories require you to have an excellent skill in thinking to grasp."

    show pg cry at two_left

    pg "Are you saying I'm not smart enough to understand you?"

    show weeb scared at two_right

    weeb "Uh... No...?"

    pg "...Hmph, you better not get used to talking to me like that."

    weeb "Indeed, if I were to be accompanied at a table with a girl, I would at least expect someone of a higher standar-"

    pg "There! You did it again! You're saying I look terrible!"

    show weeb scared at two_right

    weeb "What? Not at all, I am just saying that your features are, uh... Inadequate for my tastes."

    show pg think at two_left

    pg "Is there really {i}nothing{/i} about me you even find slightly attractive?!"

    show weeb think at two_right

    weeb "Well, I would need to think about it before I could give a definite answer."

    pg "You can't even think of anything from the top of your head?! Seriously?!"

    #TODO: show May walking

    show pg scared at two_left

    pg "What about her? That girl that's always after Rumi. She is annoying and even smaller than me."

    weeb "Well..."
    pg "\"Well\" what?"

    show weeb happy at two_right

    weeb "There is a certain charm to her. I cannot describe it. I believe that if Rumi hadn't tried her luck, I would have tried it myself."
    weeb "Having a girl try to fight for your affection all the time seems like something that happens to an antagonist of an epic story."

    show pg think at two_left

    pg "For real? Even her?"

    show weeb think at two_right

    weeb "She would still be a second pick if uh... That helps."

    pg "...Seriously, weren't you supposed to get advice from Rumi on how to treat girls..."
