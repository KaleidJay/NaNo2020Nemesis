    "Her so-called \"friends\" were actively bullying {i}me{/i} now."
    "Anna especially."
    "Angela was hit as collateral as well since she stuck to me, but I was apparently too \"lame\" for them now."
    "I had tried to be friendly to them, but..."

    "We had managed to slip out of our previous class just very slightly earlier so that we would be able to confront them before they went to lunch, but our timing was off."

    "The bell had just rung, and people were eager to get some food inside the lunchroom."

    mc "So... You know, in the last few days-"

    popgirl "Hold up."

    mc "...Uhm?"

    "Anna double walked around the lockerroom once more, seemingly to make sure nobody was around for some reason."

    "After confirming it, she went back and faced me."

    mc "Uhm... So as I was sayi-"

    popgirl "Do you {i}really{/i} think someone like you should be able to come and confront {i}me{/i} about \"bullying\" people?"

    popgirl "I assume that's what you're here for."

    mc "Eek!"

    "With no warning and full force, she straight up {i}punched{/i} the locker right behind me, only just missing my head."
    "A massive crack of metal could be heard, which had me in complete shock."

    show Anna at one with dissolve

    "She was incredibly close to me, and her height meant that she was looking down on me with extremely threatening eyes."

    popgirl "{size=-5}Now, you listen here you sack of garbage.{/size}"

    popgirl "{size=-5}You've made the life of many people in this school a living hell. Now you finally get a piece of the cake, and all of a sudden you have the {i}tenacity{/i} to come and beg for mercy?{/size}"

    popgirl "{size=-5}Don't make me laugh.{/size}"

    mc "{size=-8}S- So- Sorry!{/size}"

    "I was still in complete shock at the sudden show of violence and could only look at her while I was leaning myself on the lockers behind me."

    "She finally took her fist off the lockers, and a bit of relief came over me, but I still dreaded what she'd do now."

    "Anna suddenly felt like a complete wild-card, and it was terrifying looking her in the eyes."
    "My body would take heavy damage if she actually wanted to hit me, I knew that much."

    popgirl "...Hah."
    popgirl "You really are pathetic. Someone finally puts you in your place, and all you can do is stand there and cower like some scared kitten."

    "She put her hand around the bottom of my chin, like some pervert in a movie, and looked at me for a few seconds."

    popgirl "The only reason I even bothered to sit at the same table as you was to bring you down."

    popgirl "Watching you made me sick. Seriously sick."

    popgirl "I thought that maybe I could influence you to not be such a massive dump of a personality, but instead you decided to go crazy all by yourself."
    "She let go of me and laughed to herself."
    popgirl "So in the end, you really did me a favor by going nuts and giving me the opportunity to be the one who runs this shop."

    "I was still motionless. I never thought I would be this afraid of another person, especially a girl."

    "She looked around once more to make sure nobody was watching."

    popgirl "You satisfied with your answer?"

    popgirl "Or do you need more convincing?"

    "I simply shook my head in response to her question."
    popgirl "Good. Now go back and play slut with Rick."

    popgirl "Next time, I'll make sure that I won't miss. I'd rather hit something that isn't as hard as the lockers."

    hide Anna with dissolve

    "With that, she got up and left after picking up her things."

    popgirl "{size=-10}Shit, that hurt.{/size}"

    "I slowly slid down the locker I was leaning up on."
    "It was still a sense of shock, at how sudden everything was."
    "She just fully threatened me with violence if I bothered her again."


    think "What the fuck?!"

    "I looked up at the spot on the locker that she punched."
    "It had a quite the bulge inwards."

    think "Just how strong is Anna? I knew she was tall, but to also be able to just bend metal like that after hitting it is way too extreme!"

    think "...Fuck."
