    "And then, A week later..."
    pg "We're doing it now, right?"
    mc "No better time than now."

    pg "Okay. You can count on me."

    "So..."
    "While the relationship with Rumi steadily improved for the better, other things started to surface now as well."
    "When Rumi had told me that popularity is important for girls, I really doubted her, but it did impact me after all."
    "Her so-called {q}friends{/q} were actively bullying {i}me{/i} now."
    "Popgirl especially."
    "PG was hit as collateral as well since she stuck to me, but I was apparently too {q}lame{/q} for them now."
    "I had tried to be friendly to them, but..."

    r "{i}You're too soft, you're not interacting with them enough, and your image is in the gutter.{/i}"

    r "{i}Of course they would start turning on you. Popgirl had her eyes on my position for a long time now.{/i}"

    pg "{i}The only reason we even let Popgirl stay with us is because she wouldn't cause trouble then.{/i}"

    mc "{i}...You guys are talking as if this is a full on conspiracy.{/i}"

    r "{i}It is. You've already seen it, haven't you?{/i}"

    mc "{i}....Well...{/i}"

    "I did."
    "At first they completely stopped interacting with me."
    "I didn't think much of it. To be honest, it didn't really bother me since I never really knew them."
    "But later, I was practically put into Caren's shoes."

    #scene bg lunch
    "At this point, we just wanted them to stop bothering us. We decided in unison to confront Popgirl's group and talk this out."
    "We had managed to slip out of our previous class just very slightly earlier so that we would be able to confront them before they went to lunch, but our timing was off."

    "The bell had just rung, and people were eager to get some food inside the lunchroom."

    pg "There! They are headed towards the lockers."
    "They used the lunchroom as a shortcut to what seemed like the lockers. An infinitely better place to talk with them than in here."
    think "Well, cripes, guess it makes more sense to talk with them alone by the lockers anyways."

    #scene bg locker

    "We followed them to the lockers."
    "Only Popgirl was with her."

    "While chatting, they noticed us approaching them."

    mc "Hey."

    popgirl "...What do {i}you{/i} want?"

    mc "Can we talk about what's going on? Like honest people?"
    popgirl "...?"

    "Popgirl looked at rfriend, who just slightly shrugged her shoulders."

    "With a slight smile going across her face, she turned back towards me."

    popgirl "Alright. Let's talk alone, you and me."

    mc "M- Me?"
    popgirl "Exactly."

    mc "Uh... Alright. Is it alright PG?"

    pg "Sure. You know what to say."

    popgirl "I'll see you in a second. I just need to clear things up here."

    rfriend "Heh."

    "All three gathered their things and left for the lunchroom. pg clearly didn't want to accompany them, so she took the long way around rather than the short path."

    "With seemingly nobody around, I started to say what I wanted to say."

    mc "So... You know, in the last few days-"

    popgirl "Hold up."

    mc "...Uhm?"

    "Popgirl double walked around the lockerroom once more, seemingly to make sure nobody was around for some reason."

    "After confirming it, she went back and faced me."

    mc "Uhm... So as I was sayi-"

    popgirl "Do you {i}really{/i} think someone like you should be able to come and confront {i}me{/i} about {q}bullying{/q} people?"

    popgirl "I assume that's what you're here for."

    mc "We- Well, I've done a lot of bad things, apparently, and I realize that now, but-"

    #Popgirl smash MC (Need to look for assets)

    mc "Eek!"

    "With no warning and full force, she straight up {i}punched{/i} the locker right behind me, only just missing my head."
    "A massive crack of metal could be heard, which had me in complete shock."
    "She was incredibly close to me, and her height meant that she was looking down on me with extremely threatening eyes."

    popgirl "{size=-5}Now, you listen here you sack of garbage.{/size}"

    popgirl "{size=-5}You've made the life of many people in this school a living hell. Now you finally get a piece of the cake, and all of a sudden you have the {i}tenacity{/i} to come and beg for mercy?{/size}"

    popgirl "{size=-5}Don't make me laugh.{/size}"

    mc "{size=-8}S- So- Sorry!{/size}"

    "I was still in complete shock at the sudden show of violence and could only look at her while I was leaning myself on the lockers behind me."

    "She finally took her fist off the lockers, and a bit of relief came over me, but I still dreaded what she'd do now."

    "Popgirl suddenly felt like a complete wild-card, and it was terrifying looking her in the eyes."
    "My body would take heavy damage if she actually wanted to hit me, I knew that much."

    popgirl "...Hah."
    popgirl "You really are pathetic. Someone finally puts you in your place, and all you can do is stand there and cower like some scared kitten."

    "She put her hand around the bottom of my chin, like some pervert in a movie, and looked at me for a few seconds."

    popgirl "The only reason I even bothered to sit at the same table as you was to bring you down."

    popgirl "Watching you made me sick. Seriously sick."

    popgirl "I thought that maybe I could influence you to not be such a massive dump of a personality, but instead you decided to go crazy all by yourself."
    "She let go of me and laughed to herself."
    popgirl "So in the end, you really did me a favor by going nuts and giving me the opportunity to be the one who runs this shop."

    "I was still motionless. I never thought I would be this afraid of another person, especially a girl."

    "She looked around once more to make sure nobody was watching."

    popgirl "You satisfied with your answer?"

    popgirl "Or do you need more convincing?"

    "I simply shook my head in response to her question."
    popgirl "Good. Now go back and play slut with Weeb."

    popgirl "Next time, I'll make sure that I won't miss. I'd rather hit something that isn't as hard as the lockers."

    "With that, she up and left after picking up her things."

    popgirl "{size=-10}Shit, that hurt.{/size}"

    "I slowly slid down the locker I was leaning up on."
    "It was still a sense of shock, at how sudden everything was."
    "She just fully threatened me with violence if I bothered her again."


    think "What the fuck?!"

    "I looked up at the spot on the locker that she punched."
    "It had a quite the bulge inwards."

    think "Just how strong is Popgirl? I knew she was tall, but to also be able to just bend metal like that after hitting it is way too extreme!"

    think "...Fuck."

    #scene bg lunch with Rumi, PG and Weeb

    "Regardless, I decided that I should still join the others for lunch."

    "There were only a few minutes left of lunch break, but I had lost all appetite anyways."

    pg "...There you are! I was worried sick when Popgirl came in here long ago but you were nowhere to be found!"

    mc "Oh... Uhm, hey."

    pg "What took you so long?"

    mc "Nothing... Nothing."

    r "...?"

    r "Sounds like something you'd say when something happened."

    mc "No, I just, uhm... Think we just should avoid her, Popgirl, you know."

    "Rumi took a bite from her sandwich before answering."

    r "Wasn't the entire purpose to make her stop treating you like some 3rd world citizen?"

    "PG and Rumi both eyed me curiously. Obviously they knew something was up. But it's not like it really mattered."
    "If I told them about what happened, they might just end up making matters worse."

    r "{i}Sigh...{/i} Guess you're going silent, huh. Well, your problem."
    "Rumi didn't seem to care much, PG still looked at me worried, but went back to taking her last bites out of her burger anyhow."

    r "Weeb, explain to him what we're doing after school."

    weeb "Ah, sure thing."

    think "Oh right, he is here as well."

    m "MC!"

    r "Oh fu-!"

    r "I'll see you later!"
