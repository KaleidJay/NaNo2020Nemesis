    #show Kat, Caren and Anuja at the door of the classroom
    think "Wha-"
    "For some reason, Kat, Caren and Anuja were here before I could get out of my classroom."
    pg "What do {i}you{/i} want?"
    katrina "Buzz off. I need to talk with her in private."
    mc "Me?"
    katrina "Yes, you."
    pg "Hell no you aren't-"

    mc "Hey, PG, it's okay."

    mc "Just you and me?"

    katrina "Yes."

    mc "Fine."

    "I was hoping for the day where they would finally try to talk with me again. I expected they would come around sooner than this, but better late than never."

    mc "And {i}don't{/i} start any quarrels with the other two while I'm gone, got it?"

    pg "Tch, fine."

    "Kat looked at me with serious eyes all the time."

    scene black

    "We eventually got to a corner where nobody else was around."

    "I was honestly interested in hearing what she wanted to talk with me about. Ideally, she'd finally believe me about the swap."

    mc "This looks private enough."

    mc "..."

    mc "..."

    katrina "..."

    katrina "MC has been doing some screwed up stuff lately, you know that, right?"

    katrina "Stuff that I know he wouldn't have done."

    katrina "I know that he liked his hair the way it was, and that he never really was into all of that love-life crap."
    katrina "So to see him suddenly {q}confess{/q} to Emily and that new girl on the same day makes me incredibly sus."

    mc "Ah, ye-"

    mc "She did what?!"

    katrina "None of this is something he would have done."

    katrina "At the same time, you suddenly dress up like a total geek, have the worst hair-do since middle-school and act all nice towards your pathetic group of posh-ups."

    katrina "So, without any tricks, are you for real the actual mc who looks like this bitch right now?"

    mc "Finally, you get it. Yes!"

    "While I was hoping for her to be a bit more energetic about this, she instead looked kind of sad."

    "Did I say something wrong now all of a sudden? Was I not supposed to be happy that she finally came around to it?"

    katrina "Just... How did this happen then? Weeb has been spamming us with texts about what he is doing and what happened, but..."

    mc "Well that's the thing, none of us know what happened. It just... Suddenly happened overnight."

    katrina "But why her?"

    mc "I really don't know..."

    katrina "{size=-5}Why her...{/size}"

    mc "It's... Sorry, but I didn't have a say in that..."

    "I knew Kat hated Rumi with an absolute burning passion."
    "Their background was still a mystery to me since they seemed to be close as kids, but pg said I was better off not knowing about this."

    think "Maybe now I can ask though..."

    mc "Hey, would you mind if I asked what happened between you and her when you were kids?"

    "Her sad face turned bright all of a sudden."

    katrina "I would very much mind."

    mc "...Uhm... Why?"

    katrina "Because, Rumi. That's why."

    katrina "-I -I mean, MC. Sorry."

    "For some reason her voice trembled with embarrassment. So something must have happened that neither Rumi nor Kat would want me to know."

    think "{i}Sigh...{/i} Honestly, these guys."

    mc "Then, if you don't mind me asking, do you hang out with Anuja a lot now? I saw that she was with you, and I think I've seen you talk occasionally a lot as well..."

    katrina "It's, uh... It's because of Sandra..."

    think "Sandra...? Wasn't there a rumor about her at some point?"
    mc "Did something happen to her?"

    katrina "{i}Sigh...{/i} Well for one, she's gone insane..."

    mc "Insane? What happened to her?"

    katrina "Don't you dare tell this to someone else. I'm trusting that you're the real MC I know on this."

    mc "Your trust is well placed then."

    katrina "...One day when she woke up, Anuja found her rolling on the ground with her entire room completely destroyed."

    katrina "Everything had been thrown around, and everyone says Sandra herself did it, almost as if possessed by some kind of demon."

    mc "...Wha..."

    katrina "It was so bad that her fingernails were almost entirely ripped off, and... There was blood everywhere on her hands and face when they found her..."

    mc "...Holy shit..."

    katrina "I've heard about it from Anuja and Sandra's parents. Anuja said that when she first saw Sandra like that, Sandra was mumbling as if talking another language entirely..."
    katrina "It freaked Anuja completely to the point where she now has nightmares about it..."

    katrina "And, uh... Well, Anuja now lives with my family for the time being after that."

    mc "..."

    "What the actual fuck?"

    "Sandra always seemed like a stable role-student who was organized and had everything in order..."
    "Just how would it ever make sense that she'd just wake up one night and suddenly go mental like that..."
    "I could only shudder thinking about it."

    mc "Is she okay?"

    katrina "She's supposedly still in the hospital. I haven't heard from her since then. Not even Anuja knows anything."
    katrina "Apparently she is under lock and key so that she doesn't hurt anyone or... Attempt suicide..."

    mc "...Shit, I'm so sorry to hear that. You two were close friends even though I never really talked to her, right?"

    katrina "..."

    katrina "It's... Been a tough couple of weeks lately. And I'm sorry I... Didn't believe you at first when you said you were MC."

    mc "Hey, I don't blame you at all if that happened without my knowing."

    mc "Besides, the people we've told were all really skeptical about it as well, except for Weeb."

    katrina "Thanks, but..."

    "She looked at me for a brief moment in consideration."

    katrina "I'm sorry, I just can't..."

    katrina "You look exactly like her, sound like her, smell like her..."

    katrina "{size=-5}...The guy I liked more than anything turned into the girl I hate more than anything...{/size}"

    "It was a mumble, but I could still hear her clearly."

    "It came over me that she just said she liked me, probably more than a friend."

    "But... It just felt kind of... Empty to me for some reason?"

    mc "Is that so... I, uh... Thanks, I guess..."

    katrina "{size=-8}You guess, huh...{/size}"
    katrina "I don't have any ill will against you, or hate you MC..."

    katrina "But I just cannot look at you right now and not hate you."

    katrina "We are still friends, but..."

    katrina "I wanted to tell you that. It's selfish of me to say this, but when you go back to being yourself, please tell me as soon as possible."

    katrina "But until then, I..."
    "..."
    mc "Oh..."

    think "What is wrong with me?! A girl, Kat of all people, is probably pouring out her heart for me right now, and all I am thinking of are just passive thoughts!"

    think "{q}Ah, so that's how it is.{/q}"
    think "{q}That's a bummer.{/q}"

    think "How are any of these thoughts even acceptable in this situation? Is this body really affecting me so much that I feel nothing but apathy for her feelings?"

    think "Come on, head! Feel sympathy!"

    katrina "Sorry."

    "She waited a few seconds before walking away."

    "I didn't have a response. I wasn't extremely torn about it. Everything was a mess."

    "It was sad, and a tear of regret not being able to respond to her feelings did roll down my cheek, but I didn't know if that was the {q}old me{/q} somehow weeping or not."

    caren "Are you okay?"

    mc "Huh? Oh, Caren."

    caren "I just wanted to make sure you are okay. If Kat and Weeb both believe it's you, then I do too, mc."

    mc "Heh, thanks."

    mc "I'm guessing you want to stay with Kat."

    caren "You already know then."

    caren "Yes, she's going through a lot right now, so I think it is best if I stay by her side."

    mc "Makes sense..."

    caren "..."

    caren "You know, if it really is you, I still consider you as one of my best friends, if that worries you."
    caren "Weeb has been texting us a lot about finding a solution to revert this swap of personality that you and Rumi have experienced, and I'll try giving it a shot to figure out what happened as well."

    caren "If I find or need anything, I will let Weeb know. And I hope everything goes well between you and Rumi."

    mc "...Thanks. It helps knowing you're supporting me through this."

    caren "Heh, don't mention it."

    caren "I'm going to have to run now, we're still in school after all. I'll catch you later at some point."

    mc "Ah, yeah. I hope we can talk more later."

    caren "Me too. Good luck."

    "She gave me a really heartwarming smile before leaving."
    think "She knew exactly what Kat would be telling me, didn't she?"

    "At least I wouldn't go from this spot with nothing but depressing thoughts in my mind. Knowing Caren was fine with our situation was a great boost in confidence."

    think "After all, if someone knows something about mysteries, it's Caren."

    think "Well, Weeb does as well, but his methods are a bit more unorthodox."

    pg "Finally."

    mc "Sorry to make you wait. I hope you didn't start anything back here."

    pg "Of course not. I do have self restraint after all."
    pg "But what were you talking about?"

    mc "Just... It's, uh... Private..."

    pg "Tch, fine. Keep your secrets then."
