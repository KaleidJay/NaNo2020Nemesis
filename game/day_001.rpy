    #add room scene

    #add alarm sound

    mc "United States of..."

    #add breaking alarm sound

    mc "SMASH!"

    think "Wait..."

    think "Did I ever set set an alarm?"

    #$ screenfilter.blur = 15

    "I hesitantly opened my eyes, way too tired but not enough to be asleep. It was as if I had sleep too much and not enough."

    "I tried to take my phone, which was always at my left, but a wall was there."

    think "Has there ever be a wall in my left side?"

    #$ screenfilter.blur = 10

    think "Why is my bed... pink... ?"

    #$ screenfilter.blur = 0

    think "Where the hell am I?"

    #show black sprite

    "The alarm was still ringing, and I sat myself up in the bed I was in, which was in any way mine, starting to panick."

    mc "Did I drink something yesterd-"

    think "Was it..."

    think "...me?"

    mc "One, two, three... Why do I..."

    "I was clearly too confused."

    think "This is becoming a bit too freaky for me. This isn't my voice, nor my hands... or hairs!"

    "I rushed out of bed."

    #show more precisely the bedroom

    think "A mirror... I need a mirror..."

    #black screen

    "I opened the closest closet I could find."

    #add Rumi's CG

    "Luckily, there was a big-ass mirror inside."

    "With one look, my suspicions were confirmed, for the better or the worse."

    mc "Rumi?!"

    mc "I'm... Rumi?"

    mc "What the actual fuck is that?"

    "This is a dream... Right?"

    think "This isn't a dream... If it was, I would have already woken up from this nightmare."

    think "...How the hell does someone just suddenly become someone else?!"

    "Rumi..."

    "She is what you could call the popular girl of our high school. The type who is always pretty and polite with the teachers but bully the ones who aren't her minions."

    mc "Just the worst to become."

    "I kept staring at {i}myself{/i} in the mirror, still under the shock of the discovery."

    "As I began to understand this wasn't just a dream, and that I was currently one of the best lookings girls in school, I blushed."

    #go back to the room with MC going out of the closet

    "I pushed all of this aside for later. {s}My{/s} Rumi's alarm had been ringing since I woke up."

    think "It's really..."

    #add custom choice

    #if "Incredible!" selected, use a smug face
    #if "Weird!" selected, use a sad face

    think "Come to think of this, if I am her..."

    think "Is she me?"

    mc "Fuck."

    "If she really turned into me, then I {b}need{/b} to find her as soon as possible."

    think "Today is the first school day of my senior year, and Rumi's also in her senior year now. I need to go to school as early as I can."

    pg "But then what are you going to do in the meantime?"

    mc "Just do it."

    pg "Alright then. Jeez, you're moody today."

    "Choosing to once more ignore her statement, I placed myself leaning up a wall and waited."

    "And waited."

    "I couldn't check the time because I had no phone or watch on me, but as a sudden flood of people appeared, I knew it was close to ten minutes left until we had to meet at the ceremony."

    #Saw Rumi in MC's body, angry

    think "Great..."

    "I thought of how to approach {i}me{/i}, but the moment my own body saw me, it sprinted towards me."

    r "{b}{i}YOU!{/i}{/b}"

    think "Yep, she's pissed."

    r "You! We're going to talk!"

    mc "Alright, alright."

    "She had grabbed me by my hand and straight up yoinked me in the opposite direction of where all the other students were headed."

    #scene garden

    "She lead me to the garden of the school. With everyone soon attending the entrance ceremony, there was nobody around."
    "And she made sure of that before erupting at me like a volcano."

    r "Explain. Right now! Are you that bitch's pet mc?!"

    mc "Rumi, calm down."

    r "Calm down?! Are you for real?! How am I supposed to be calm when you're trying to steal my fucking life right in front of me!"

    mc "Steal your life?"

    r "I've been calling my phone for half a fucking hour now and it went to {i}MY OWN{/i} voicemail {b}EVERY TIME!{/b}"

    think "Well, I already thought as much, but she isn't the cause for this swap between us then?"

    mc "I didn't do anything. I woke up and I find out I'm you for god knows what reason."

    mc "But it sure sounds like you didn't have anything to do with it either."

    r "Oh, please. Someone like you would be begging to be me. Of course you have something to do with this!"

    #pissed MC

    mc "Listen here, you stuck-up sissy. I would rather spend eternity walking around as a WcDonalds employee than have to live your pathetic life of bullying for a single day."

    mc "Yeah, so what if you look good? But you are still rotten to the core."

    r "Hohohoh, okay, someone like you tries to badmouth me? Of course that's the only thing you're good for like the absolute bottom feeder you are. You probably spend your life, like, playing video games and doing absolutely nothing all day."

    r "I bet if laughter really is the best medicine there is, then reading your life story could be curing the world right now as we are {b}fucking speaking!{/b}"

    think "Why did I ever think I could cooperate with this woman."

    mc "Fuck you too. If you like insulting me so much, then how about we just stay like this until dear mc over yonder my sight goes ahead and apologizes to the tyrannical bitch."

    mc "You value your reputation, right? Do you want to see me fuck it up into an unrepairable state, or would you rather figure out how to reverse this shit?"

    r "You wouldn't even dare. You're fucking dead if you attempt anythi-"

    "She stopped in her tracks as if realizing something."

    r "Did you touch me?"

    mc "Did I wha-"

    r "{b}DID YOU FUCKING TOUCH ME?!{/b}"

    mc "What do you think?! I was in a hurry to get to school to figure out what's going on myself! And it is kind of hard getting clothes on without touching my own body! Or would you rather I come in underwear?"

    mc "And are you just constantly angry or something? Jesus fucking Christ, can we stop screaming at each other and fix this?!"

    mc "I've already told you that I absolutely hate you! If I could swap with anyone then you would be my very last pick!"

    r "Are you seriously trying to make me believe you didn't do this shit?"

    mc "YES! OH MY GOD, YES!"

    r "Hngh- Then- "

    #see Rumi kick a bucket

    "She turned around and kicked a bucket with no holding back. It was clear as day that Rumi was absolutely livid."

    "She stood there, probably venting her rage inside her head for a few seconds."

    "And when I say \"a few seconds\", I mean, she sure took her sweet time."

    "When she was finally done, she took a deep breath."

    r "{size=-7}Okay. Relax, Rumi. You're the one in control. You're the queen of this stupid school. Good things are to come.{/size}"

    r "Phew. Okay, fuck it. I don't believe you, but I'm not going to stay like this, so let's just find a way to go back to normal."

    mc "Good, now if-"

    r "And if you're lying to me, then kiss goodbye to everything you love. Get it?"

    mc "Ow, fuck! Calm your tits, I'm not lying! And it's clear as day that you aren't either. So someone must have done this!"

    r "Obviously."

    mc "Now could you please get your hands off me? You've established that you're the physically strong one here."

    r "Hmph..."

    mc "You know, that really hurt."

    "Not really much of an apology coming from her, is there? She really hit me hard on my shoulder, even though she probably didn't intend to use that amount of force."

    mc "...Anyways, I'm guessing what we're left with is that someone must have done this."

    r "Or something."

    mc "Something?"

    r "It sure as fuck isn't a coincidence that {i}we{/i} were swapped, but even a preschooler would know that this could just by chance be a coincidence."

    mc "You mean, we just happened to magically get swapped randomly?"

    r "What else, moron?"

    "I clenched my fist at her constant jabbing but endured it for now. I would be sure to get back at her in some way, but that's for when we actually know what triggered this."

    mc "Okay, so something, or someone, caused this."

    "..."

    r "Seriously? That's it? You really can't think of anything else?"

    mc "Like what?"

    r "Who did this? Why they did this? How they did this? What caused it? Anything actually helpful?"

    mc "Then let's hear your {i}oh so wise{/i} opinion."

    r "If someone did this, they would have to be close to us for them to be interested in actually doing this, right?"

    mc "Which just about rules in, what, possibly the entire school?"

    r "If you could let the people who know a thing or two about actually thinking with their heads talk, you would get that it rules out many more."

    r "Loads of jealous bitches are after me, I'm at the top of the food chain after all. But why anyone would want to mess with a shipwreck like you is beyond me."

    mc "That's a very humble way of saying that you're someone everyone in school hates looking at."

    r "As if you could understand how it is to be the alpha. Having loads of jealous vixens after me is part of the job, after all."

    mc "Yeah, no, you're just a d-bag towards everyone."

    mc "But you're saying that more people would be after you than me?"

    r "Yes, and that includes that orange slut of yours you call a friend, and maybe Nerdy McNerd."

    mc "Could you {i}not{/i} try to bully people when trying to talk?"

    #scared Rumi

    r "..."

    mc "...What?"

    r "...."

    mc "What?"

    r "Explain to me why I am not wearing any make-up."

    mc "Why is that a worry?! We've got bigger issues at hand!"

    r "Oh my god, this is the end of me."

    #School bell

    "We had both lost track of time entirely, but the school bell, which was supposed to be a signal that indicates that everyone should be seated right now in the school hall, broke our conversation completely."

    mc "Shit, we're going to be late on the one day we can't be late on."

    r "Meet me here at lunch again. And you better fucking show up."

    mc "Alright, alright."

    #show them leave

    pause 1.0

    scene black

    "With that, we silently rushed to the ceremony together."

    "As tough as it was to admit, Rumi must be a bit more organized. The only thing I could think of was that someone must have done this."

    "Despite her burning anger which could rival the sun itself, she had some ideas of things to think about."

    "Unless I wanted to be bested by this bird-brain, I would have to think of some things as well."

label Day1_Rumi:

    r "{size=-5} Ugh, I can only shudder at having to live like a guy.{/size}"
    think "But I can fix this. Everything is going to work my way eventually. If it can happen once, it can happen twice."

    #scene school hallway

    "I got angry when some people just crossed right past without letting me through. Normally I'd assert my dominance, but the only dominance I could establish like this would be dominance over a chicken coop."

    think "Why did this have to happen with this guy..."

    think "It could at least have been one of the popular guys, or at least someone who isn't an absolute lame-ass."

    "Either way, I finally got around to finding '{i}my{/i}' class."

    tea "Ah, there you are. With you it finally makes it 28. Looks like everyone is here."

    tea "Follow me and I'll show you our homeroom."

    #transition to garden

    "When lunch finally came around, I managed to go to the garden."

    "I've been in the garden for five minutes now, but MC still wasn't here."

    think "Oh, he better not be creeping himself out with my body right now..."

    #disgusted Rumi

    "Just the thought of that retard being able to do anything with my beauty crept me out to no ends."

    "Honest to god, I would probably have broken down if he didn't show up a minute or so later."

    #show MC walking

    r "About fucking time you came."

    mc "Hey. Sorry, I had to take care of something first."

    r "Excuse me? Take care of what? Did you actually feel me up or some shit?!"

    mc "Don't gross me out here, your mutt kept on clinging on to me until I told her to screw off. Seriously, how do you get rid of her?"

    "Oh, of course. She existed. I had to rub myself on my forehead since I knew Corny would become a pain in the ass at some point."

    r "{i}Sigh... {/i} That bitch does everything except fuck off when I tell her to."

    r "And I hope you didn't tell anyone about this for your own sake."

    mc "Well, no. I find it hard to just tell people without preparing."
    think "Don't tell me this idiot still hasn't figured out..."
    r "If someone caused this swap, then we don't know who it is."

    mc "That's a given."

    mc "But why are you so afraid of telling the one responsible? What difference would it make if we tell them or not?"

    r "It's obviously not because I'm afraid of telling the one responsible. It's because if I tell someone who isn't responsible, they can attack me."

    r "I'm not trusting anyone in this school. As soon as they know a weakness, they will exploit me and take my position at the top."

    r "If we admit this to anyone, then not only am I practically announcing that I lost this fight that they started, but I also give people the opportunity to take everything from me. And I'm not fucking losing, like, ever. Got that drilled into your head?"

    r "You're going to help me find literally any clue you can. And I'm not taking no for an answer."

    mc "{i}Sigh...{/i} Fine. Our interests are the same so I don't see why I shouldn't help..."

    r "Stop making that face with my face!"

    mc "..."

    think "This absolute dickhead is making me look like a complete idiot."

    mc "But! One thing before you continue commanding me around like one of your shitty friends: We are on equal footing here. If you're going to treat me like your underling then I'm going to do my own thing, get it?"

    mc "I'd like to think that I am better than you though, so I don't mind going along with what you're saying. But there are lines that you should not cross."

    r "Oh man, your attempt at being humble is just {i}too{/i} sweet."

    mc "Also, we both hate each other, but could we treat each other with just a bit of respect until this thing is over? Like normal human beings?"

    think "As if I could treat anyone who isn't me a respectful or decent human, hah."

    r "Whatever. First off, let's figure out what could have triggered this. Tell me what you did yesterday."

    mc "Well, I did a lot of things, actually."

    r "Watch me care for how active you are in your boring life. Just tell already."

    "He rolled his eyes as if trying to play smart."

    mc "First off, you're hungry, right?"

    r "I am {i}not{/i} going to act as your pathetic girlfriend and go buy lunch with you if that is what you're hoping."

    mc "I just bought two sandwiches before coming here, so can you calm the fuck down with your assumptions?"

    "He took out the food he purchased {i}with MY{/i} money and handed me one."

    think "What guy isn't going to take advantage of me like this anyways? He might be lying to himself, but he isn't going to lie to me."

    think "I bet he is thinking to himself that this is bringing us closer like some shitty 90's movie."

    think "Phew, if she found out I was checking her out in the mirror before going here..."

    "Yeah, the story was fake, so what? I look like some girl out of a dream, and confessing to myself in a mirror is something I'm in my full right to do."
    "...Actually, it sounds kind of sad to do that."
    "But at least she bought the excuse and calmed down after being handed something to eat."
    "I couldn't imagine how bad things would get if she intentionally started to sabotage my life, but just the possibility meant that I have to be careful."

    "Going along with her \"ideas\" or whatever you call them was in my opinion the wisest decision."
    "Being Rumi for a bit of time could be fun, but for it to be permanent or anything close to it is a big no-no."

    mc "So anyways, you asked about what I did the day before, right?"

    #Show MC in his body and in his room

    mc "{i}Hm, I started by getting out of bed of course, I think that was at about twelve in the morning.{/i}"

    r "{i}Pfft!{/i}"

    r "{i}I'm not even surprised at how boring your life has to be if you're playing effing video games on a saturday night, {b}pfhaaahahaha{/b}~{/i}"

    mc "{i}Yeah, real funny. I thought you wanted to know what I did yesterday, but here you are interrupting the short time we have to talk.{/i}"
    r "{i}~ahaah, yeah. I think you may be right for once.{/i}"

    #Frustrated Rumi

    r "{b}{size=+5}AGH!{/size}{/b} That has {i}NOTHING{/i} in common with what I did!"

    "Seeing Rumi frustrated was a weird feeling, she was usually so asserting and hard-headed."

    think "I have to remember this is still Rumi, the number one bitch in this school."

    r "What about the people?"

    "Rotten as she may be, I could sympathize just a bit with her. She must not like this at all."

    r "Now... Don't be late to my class, if I don't get good grades, then..."

    "I would have wanted to write a few notes to her too, but... She stormed off after I confirmed her intentions of murder if I did anything she didn't like."
